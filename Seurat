# Load the PBMC dataset
pbmc.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "B:/Single Cell/test_data/seurat_tutorial/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19")
# Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data).
pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = "pbmc3k", min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)
pbmc

# The [[ operator can add columns to object metadata. This is a great place to stash QC stats
pbmc[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = "^MT-")

# Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), ncol = 3)

# FeatureScatter is typically used to visualize feature-feature relationships, but can be used
# for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in object metadata, PC scores etc.

plot1 <- FeatureScatter(pbmc, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "percent.mt")
plot2 <- FeatureScatter(pbmc, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "nFeature_RNA")
plot1 + plot2

pbmc <- subset(pbmc, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 2500 & percent.mt < 5)

### Normalizing the data ###

pbmc <- NormalizeData(pbmc, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)

pbmc <- NormalizeData(pbmc)


### Identification of highly variable features (feature selection) ###


pbmc <- FindVariableFeatures(pbmc, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)

# Identify the 10 most highly variable genes
top10 <- head(VariableFeatures(pbmc), 10)

# plot variable features with and without labels
plot1 <- VariableFeaturePlot(pbmc)
plot2 <- LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE)
plot1 + plot2


### Scaling the data ###

all.genes <- rownames(pbmc)
pbmc <- ScaleData(pbmc, features = all.genes)


### Perform linear dimensional reduction ###

pbmc <- RunPCA(pbmc, features = VariableFeatures(object = pbmc))

# Examine and visualize PCA results a few different ways
print(pbmc[["pca"]], dims = 1:5, nfeatures = 5)

VizDimLoadings(pbmc, dims = 1:2, reduction = "pca")


DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "pca")

DimHeatmap(pbmc, dims = 1, cells = 500, balanced = TRUE)

DimHeatmap(pbmc, dims = 1:15, cells = 500, balanced = TRUE)


### Determine the ‘dimensionality’ of the dataset ###

# NOTE: This process can take a long time for big datasets, comment out for expediency. More
# approximate techniques such as those implemented in ElbowPlot() can be used to reduce
# computation time
pbmc <- JackStraw(pbmc, num.replicate = 100)
pbmc <- ScoreJackStraw(pbmc, dims = 1:20)
JackStrawPlot(pbmc, dims = 1:15)
ElbowPlot(pbmc)



### Cluster the cells ###


pbmc <- FindNeighbors(pbmc, dims = 1:10)
pbmc <- FindClusters(pbmc, resolution = 0.5)

# Look at cluster IDs of the first 5 cells
head(Idents(pbmc), 5)



### Run non-linear dimensional reduction (UMAP/tSNE) ###
# If you haven't installed UMAP, you can do so via reticulate::py_install(packages =
# 'umap-learn')
pbmc <- RunUMAP(pbmc, dims = 1:10)

# note that you can set `label = TRUE` or use the LabelClusters function to help label
# individual clusters
DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap")


saveRDS(pbmc, file = "B:/Single Cell/test_data/seurat_tutorial/pbmc_tutorial.rds")

### Finding differentially expressed features (cluster biomarkers) ###
# find all markers of cluster 2
cluster2.markers <- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 2, min.pct = 0.25)
head(cluster2.markers, n = 5)

# find all markers distinguishing cluster 5 from clusters 0 and 3
cluster5.markers <- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 5, ident.2 = c(0, 3), min.pct = 0.25)
head(cluster5.markers, n = 5)

# find markers for every cluster compared to all remaining cells, report only the positive
# ones
pbmc.markers <- FindAllMarkers(pbmc, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25)
pbmc.markers %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  slice_max(n = 2, order_by = avg_log2FC)

cluster0.markers <- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 0, logfc.threshold = 0.25, test.use = "roc", only.pos = TRUE)


VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "CD79A"))

# you can plot raw counts as well
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("NKG7", "PF4"), slot = "counts", log = TRUE)


### ！！！！！ ####
FeaturePlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "GNLY", "CD3E", "CD14", "FCER1A", "FCGR3A", "LYZ", "PPBP",
                               "CD8A"))


pbmc.markers %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = avg_log2FC) -> top10
DoHeatmap(pbmc, features = top10$gene) + NoLegend()



### Assigning cell type identity to clusters ###

new.cluster.ids <- c("Naive CD4 T", "CD14+ Mono", "Memory CD4 T", "B", "CD8 T", "FCGR3A+ Mono",
                     "NK", "DC", "Platelet")
names(new.cluster.ids) <- levels(pbmc)
pbmc <- RenameIdents(pbmc, new.cluster.ids)
DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.5)

saveRDS(pbmc, file = "B:/Single Cell/test_data/seurat_tutorial/pbmc3k_final.rds")
